While appealing to Creditors, it may be of concern for investors who will wonder about the efficient use of assets as a result of "Excess Working Capital".

It is recommended to review your Current Assets and Current Liabilities to determine the source of your "Excess Working Capital".

For example, your "Excess Working Capital" could be the result of too high of Current Assets such as Cash or Inventory.

Excess cash should be allocated to profitable projects. Investors can become concerned by a complacent management team when cash is too high.

 In the case of excess inventory, review your products and determine which are profitable and terminate the ones that are not. `

let p9q1 = `Your Interest Coverage is less than zero, in other words, negative.

This is likely caused by a negative earnings, which of course leaves no funds left over to make interest payments.

While losses in early years are typical for startups, investors will want to see progress towards Interest Coverage of at least 1.5. If your business is not in its early years, a negative Interest Coverage will raise a red flag for investors.

In addition to increasing Sales and reducing Expenses, the Interest Coverage Ratio can be improved by reducing Interest Expense. The most direct way to reduce Interest Expense is to pay off any existing debt to reduce your outstanding debt balance.

If it not possible to pay off any debt, another route could be debt consolidation, which combines smaller, higher rate interest loans into one larger loan but with a lower overall interest rate.

Another alternative is to use the "Debt Avalanche Method", paying off your highest interest rate loan balance first, and then plowing thus funds into the next highest interest rate loan and so on progressively until the target Interest Coverage has been reached.

It is also important to establish a process to continually follow up with courtesy reminders to clients with outstanding bills. Also, be sure you are offering efficient payment options, such as credit cards, online portals, Paypal, or an automatic clearinghouse. Offering incentives for early payment is another option, which could be 1 - 3% depending on your order size and profit margin. You could further include a penalty for late payment.

To improve your credit policy, review your payment terms offered and decrease them to 10 days or 2 weeks. Further reduce payment terms to customers you know can pay quicker.

This indicates you pay off your suppliers on average 1 time per year or less.

While a low A/P Turnover Ratio indicates a company is able to hold onto its cash, such a low A/P Turnover ratio will raise a red flag as it has a high probability of indicating financial distress.

This could be a problem with investors and vendors. If you are in financial distress you may have difficulty raising funds from investors or lenders and need to turn friends and family to navigate financial turbulence.

If you are not in financial distress, one option to improve your A/P Turnover is to outsource payment processing to an A/P processing company.  Another route could be to coordinate Autopayments with your vendors.

Careful budgeting and forecasting for seasonal fluctuations can also help not only Inventory Turnover but A/P turnover as well, by ensureing you do not rack up balances you cannot pay for inventory which does not sell in the off season. `
let p14q2 = `Your A/P Turnover Ratio is between 1 and 2.

This indicates you pay off your suppliers on average 1 - 2 times per year.

This is a relatively low A/P Turnover Ratio and will likely prompt questions and review from investors and vendors.

let p14q3 = `Your A/P Turnover Ratio is between 2 and 4.

This indicates you pay off your suppliers on average 2  - 4 times per year.

This may not raise a red flag but is a relatively slower payment policy which will require explanation with new vendors.

let p14q4 = `Your A/P Turnover Ratio is between 4 and 12. This indicates you pay off your suppliers on average 4  - 12 times per year.

This is a relatively healthy payment policy and unlikely to raise any red flags.

Your company should be compared to your competitors to analyze relative favorability of credit terms. `
let p14q5 = `Your A/P Turnover Ratio is over 12. This indicates you pay off your suppliers on average over 12 times per year.

This will please your creditors and suppliers but may prompt investors to question if supplier credit is sufficiently leveraged for optimal cash position.

Your company should be compared to your competitors to analyze relative favorability of credit terms.

While it may tempting to do so and investors may pressure to pay vendors slower, remember that your A/P is your vendor's A/R and so slowing vendor payments should not be done when it puts a vendor relationship at risk. `

let p15q1 = `Your Days Payables Outstanding (DPO) is less than 30.

This indicates your company pays its creditors and suppliers in 30 days or less.

This will please your creditors and suppliers but may prompt investors to question if supplier credit is sufficiently leveraged for optimal cash position. `
let p15q2 = `Your Days Payables Outstanding (DPO) is between 30 and 60.

This indicates that on average your company pays its suppliers between 1 and 2 months after the purchase is made.

This is a relatively fast payment cycle and will please vendors.  `
let p15q3 = `Your Days Payables Outstanding (DPO) is between 60 and 90.

This indicates that on average your company pays its suppliers between 2 and 3 months after a purchase is made.

This may not raise a red flag but is a relatively slower payment policy which will require explanation with new vendors.  `
let p15q4 = `Your Days Payables Outstanding (DPO) is between 90 and 120.

This indicates that on average your company pays its suppliers between 3 and 4 months after a purchase is made.

This is a relatively slow payment cycle, and is likely to raise a red flag for vendors and creditors. `
let p15q5 = `Your Days Payables Outstanding (DPO) is over 120.

This indicates that on average your company pays its suppliers over 4 months after a purchase is made.

This is a slow payment cycle and a likely indicator of financial distress. It is likely to raise a red flag for investors, creditors and vendors. `
let p16q1 = `Your Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC) is less than zero, signifying that you have a negative CCC.

Effectively, you are able to delay vendor payments until after you have paid for inventory and collected payment from customers. A negative CCC could be a good thing if it is intentional cash management.

For example Amazon, the retail powerhouse runs a Negative CCC, leveraging its clout as a retail powerhouse to dictate terms to vendors.

If your company is smaller, a Negative CCC could be caused by less positive factors which could be red flags. For example, if you are paying suppliers slower because your company does not have the cash, this is a sign of financial distress. Even if it is not distress, it could frustrate your vendors who will prefer doing business with your competitors.

Finally, if your CCC is negative because you have a cash only sales policy, this could also be limiting growth. `
let p16q2 = `Your Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC) is between 0 and 10.

This indicates you are able to collect payment on sales nearly as quickly as you make payments to suppliers.

This is a healthy range and suggests your company is liking striking a fine balance in Working Capital management, pleasing your investors and vendors.`
let p16q3 = `Your Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC) is between 10 and 30.

This indicates your Company converts Accounts Receivables into cash between 10 days and up to 1 month slower than it pays suppliers.

This is a healthy range but could leave some room for improvement, in particular if your Company is closer to  30 days.

If you would like to improve your CCC, this can be achieved by reducing inventory, reviewing both the policy for extending credit to customers as well as collecting. Perhaps a discount for early payment could be considered to accelerate A/R collections. It could also be considered to delay payments of A/P, to the extent it does not upset your vendors. `
let p16q4 = `Your Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC) is between 30 and 60.

This indicates your Company collects on its Receivables 1 to 2 months slower than it makes payments to suppliers. This is a relatively slower CCC, although it may be typical for your industry.

It is recommended to look for improvement to your CCC.  This can be achieved by reducing inventory, reviewing both the policy for extending credit to customers as well as collecting. Perhaps a discount for early payment could be considered to accelerate A/R collections. It could also be considered to delay payments of A/P, to the extent it does not upset your vendors. `
let p16q5 = `Your Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC) is greater than 60.

This indicates it takes your company significantly longer to turnover inventory and accounts receivable than it pays its suppliers. This is likely a red flag for investors who will question your operations ability to generate liquidity.

It is strongly It is recommended to look for improvement to your CCC.  This can be achieved by reducing inventory, reviewing both the policy for extending credit to customers as well as collecting. Perhaps a discount for early payment could be considered to accelerate A/R collections. It could also be considered to delay payments of A/P, to the extent it does not upset your vendors. `
let p17q1 = `Your Working Capital Turnover is less than zero, or negative in other words.

This is caused by Negative Working Capital. This will be a red flag for creditors and indicates a relatively higher probability of needing additional capital to fund daily operations.

It is recommended to improve your Working Capital Turnover. This can be achieved by increasing Sales with the same Working Capital balance, perhaps through a marketing campaign.

Another option is to decrease Working Capital for the same level of sales. This could be achieved by improving inventory management, speeding up A/R collections perhaps with an early payment discount. A final option is to delay payments of A/P, to the extent it does not upset your vendors. `
let p17q2 = `Your Working Capital Turnover is between 0 and 1.

This indicates you need at least $1 dollar or more invested in Working Capital to generate $1 dollar of sales.

This will be a red flag for investors wondering about efficient Working Capital management.

It is recommended to improve your Working Capital Turnover. This can be achieved by increasing Sales with the same Working Capital balance, perhaps through a marketing campaign.

Another option is to decrease Working Capital for the same level of sales. This could be achieved by improving inventory management, speeding up A/R collections perhaps with an early payment discount. A final option is to delay payments of A/P, to the extent it does not upset your vendors. `
let p17q3 = `Your Working Capital Turnover is between 1 and 6.

This indicates you are generating at least $1 dollar up to $6 dollars in Sales for every $1 dollar invested in Working Capital.

This is not necessarily a red flag for investors, especially if your Company is approaching 6 WC Turnover, but it does leave some room for improvement.

If you would like to improve your Working Capital Turnover, this can be achieved by increasing Sales with the same Working Capital balance, perhaps through a marketing campaign.

Another option is to decrease Working Capital for the same level of sales. This could be achieved by improving inventory management, and speeding up A/R collections perhaps with an early payment discount. A final option is to delay payments of A/P, to the extent it does not upset your vendors. `

let p17q5 = `Your Working Capital Turnover is over 12. For every 1 dollar invested in Working Capital, your Company generates 12 dollars in Sales.

This is a healthy Working Capital Turnover and will likely please investors.

A word of caution, however, is if your Working Capital Turnover is so high because you are unable or are insolvent to make payments on A/P, which could lead to impending bankruptcy. `
